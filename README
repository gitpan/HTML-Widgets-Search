DESCRIPTION
        The programmer designs a html form with some field values, then
        you can write a sql query using those fields.

        Limit only works with one database : MySQL, check www.mysql.com.
        Contribution support for other databases is required, it's not
        hard if your database has a similar feature, check the render_table
        method in the sources.

            The constuctor requires a SQL statement and a valid DBI object.

        render_table returns a HTML table with the results , if a link
        is provided every field of the table has that link.

            Give it a try, the synopsis may help you start.

TODO
        Improve the docs. You can help me !
